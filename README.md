This is a fork of the [Blackfont repository](https://github.com/i-tu/Blackfont).

It examplifies how to add a new ligature to the Blackfont font. The ligature added is a double slash, which converts `//` into a single-width character.

See [HowToAddALigature.md](HowToAddALigature.md) for instructions.
